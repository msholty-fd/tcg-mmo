# Emberwood Online — Design Notes

Running record of the vision and the decisions made along the way, with the
reasoning. Add to this as decisions land; don't rewrite history.

## The vision (Michael, 2026-07-06)

Physical TCG cards felt *alive*: a worn Blue-Eyes had a history — trades,
games, owners — even though its power never changed. Emberwood should
recapture that digitally, and go further: because we can remember everything,
each card copy accrues a real, verifiable story.

Pillar: **the world and the card game are the same universe.** Zones map to
card themes; beating a zone's duelists is how its cards enter circulation.
Shipping a new world zone and shipping a new card set are the same act.

## The Chronicle (card identity system)

- Every copy is a minted **instance**: iid, origin ("Won from Gruk the Boar
  King"), owners[] provenance chain, battle record (duels/wins/kills/hearth
  damage), renown.
- Renown from duels (server-computed): participation (win 5 / loss 2) +
  2/kill + hearthDmg/3, capped 20 per duel.
- Levels: Fresh → Seasoned (20, cosmetic patina) → **Veteran** (60, +1/+1) →
  **Storied** (150, +2/+2 + card-specific `storiedKeyword`). Frames patina and
  gild with ★ by level.

### The balance resolution (important)

Michael explicitly did NOT want cosmetic-only ("I don't want the card to
evolve and still be weak") but had no answer for balance. The resolution:
**growth is real but decks carry a Legend Budget** (8 points; Veteran=1,
Storied=2, enforced server-side). You can't field 30 legends — you build
*around* your storied cards, which is exactly the deck-with-a-soul feeling.
Don't quietly remove the budget or make growth cosmetic; both directions were
considered and rejected.

## Combat design

- Resource: **Kindle** — burn any card from hand (once/turn) for +1 permanent
  Ember. Cards are both resource and fuel; choosing what to burn is the game.
  (Solves mana screw; creates real decisions.)
- Keywords: ambush, guardian, ward, frenzy, lifesteal, piercing. Keywords are
  the extensibility surface — prefer new keywords/effect primitives over
  special-cased rules.
- Card types: creature, spell, relic (attach = buff+grantKeyword effects),
  reaction (set face-down, max 2, auto-fires on the named enemy event — see
  "Reactions, not a stack" below). Enchantment type reserved but unimplemented.
- Rules text and flavor are separate fields (`text` vs `flavor`); the hover
  inspector shows keyword glossary + rules + italic flavor.

## History of major pivots

1. Started as a WoW-style RPG (classes/abilities/mob grinding) — single HTML
   file refactored into modules.
2. Pivoted to MMO card game: classes → starter decks (Boarherd/Wardens/
   Red-Sash), mobs → ambient wildlife, kill quests → duel quests, boss mob
   Gruk → boss *duelist* Gruk.
3. Networking: real WS server, presence, PvP challenges, then full server
   authority (cards → progression → quests) added incrementally.
4. Chronicle + Legend Budget + rules-depth pass (relics, lifesteal/piercing,
   duel log, help panel) in one push.

## Decisions & rationale (append here)

- **Auth**: name+password recovers a character from any device; server issues a
  device token for auto-login. Logout is non-destructive.
- **Autobattle**: the shared AI plays your side (server flag `auto`). Improving
  `shared/engine/ai.js` upgrades NPCs, autobattle, and balance sims together.
- **Offline mode**: local NPC duels work without the server but earn no
  renown/XP/quest progress — stated honestly in the UI, by design.
- **NPC duels run server-side when online** so rewards/renown are authoritative;
  the local engine path is kept only as the offline fallback.

- **Pixel art over emoji** (explicit user call: emoji is "boring"): 16×16
  hand-authored grids in pixelArt.js, palette-swapped per family. Portraits
  for creatures, sigils for spells, icons for relics. Keep the style.
- **Rules + flavor are separate card fields** — inspector shows keyword
  glossary, rules, then italic flavor like a printed card.
- **UI philosophy**: HUD panels are player-owned (drag/close/hotkey/persist);
  hover-zoom answers "what does this card do" everywhere; Esc = universal back.
- **Night design**: night is a real phase (20-min days), never pitch black,
  torch-lit settlements as warm islands; moonlight is a fixed light so shadows
  don't crawl. Potential future hook: night-only content.

- **Trading (2026-07-07)** — the vision item, designed for trust and story:
  - *Proximity ritual*: you trade by walking up to someone (same range as a
    challenge) and pressing **T** — invite → accept, like duels. Trading is a
    thing you do *in the world*, not a global marketplace; scarcity of
    encounter is part of the fantasy (physical-TCG feel).
  - *Double-confirm with anti-scam reset*: both sides build offers (cards +
    coins); ANY change to either offer clears BOTH confirmations. Classic MMO
    pattern; prevents last-second swaps.
  - *Active-deck cards can't be traded* — keeps every deck permanently valid
    (30 cards) and makes "I'd have to un-deck it first" a natural friction on
    parting with a card you actually use.
  - *Provenance is the product*: on transfer the recipient is appended to the
    instance's owners[] chain; renown/level travel with the card. A Storied
    card that passed through four hands is the whole point of the game.
  - *Server-authoritative and atomic*: offers validated on every change AND
    re-validated at execution; both sides' cards/coins move in one step or
    not at all. Max 8 cards per side per trade. Blocked while dueling (and
    vice versa). Online-only — offline mode has no trading.

- **Card economy: packs yes, crafting no (2026-07-08)**. Coins had no sink
  (only trade-sweetening) and no repeatable faucet (95 total from quests).
  Decision: **packs complement trading, crafting substitutes for it** —
  randomness creates the dupes/gaps that make players trade, while targeted
  minting would price-ceiling every card and remove the reason to seek
  players (the Hearthstone-vs-physical-TCG split). So:
  - *Faucet*: coins per duel win — 5 NPC / 10 PvP. (Initially shipped with
    autobattled wins paying 0; reversed the same day — see the autobattle
    decision below.)
  - *Sink*: zone-scoped supply packs (shared/sets/core/packs.js), sold
    **in-world by Quartermaster Marla** (E when she has no quest business) —
    same philosophy as proximity trading, no global shop UI. Boarlands pack:
    25 coins, 5 cards from the core set, rarity-weighted 70/24/6. Pack mints
    are fresh instances (origin "Bought from Quartermaster Marla", renown 0),
    so storied traded copies stay strictly more valuable than anything money
    buys. Server validates coins + proximity and mints; client only renders.
  - *No crafting* unless pack luck proves painful in real play; then
    dupe-transmute only (same-set, same-rarity, priced above trading).
  - Considered and declined for now: surfacing duelist reward pools in
    dialogue ("Vex is known to carry…") — liked, but drop pools stay
    discovered knowledge for now.

- **Autobattle earns full rewards — coins, XP, renown (Michael, 2026-07-08)**.
  Autobattle is a **quality-of-life feature, not an exploit surface**: anyone
  who wanted to automate battling could do it other ways (the client is
  scriptable, position is client-authoritative), so nerfing the built-in
  convenience only punishes honest players. The `usedAuto` coin gate shipped
  earlier the same day was removed. This closes the long-open "idle-farming
  policy" question: idle farming is accepted. Don't re-add reward penalties
  for autobattle without revisiting this decision.

- **Reactions, not a stack (2026-07-08)**. Assessed MTG-style stack/priority
  and rejected it: priority windows multiply the timer/disconnect/AFK surface,
  fight the casual world-MMO pacing, and would force the shared AI (NPCs +
  autobattle) to reason about held-back responses. Instead: **Reaction cards**
  (Hearthstone-secret-shaped) — counterplay with zero protocol changes.
  - *Card type `reaction`*: played face-down on your turn (cost paid then),
    max **2 set** at once. Opponent sees a face-down card, not what it is.
  - *Auto-trigger*: fires on the named enemy event, is revealed, resolves,
    goes to the graveyard. If several match one event they fire in the order
    they were set. No prompts, no priority — resolution stays synchronous.
  - *Trigger events (v1)*: `enemySpell` (opponent plays a spell — fires
    BEFORE its effects, so `counter` can cancel them; ember stays spent),
    `enemyCreature` (fires AFTER the creature's onPlay resolves — reactions
    punish the body, they don't preempt the battlecry), `enemyAttack` (fires
    on attack declaration, before damage; if the attacker or the target dies
    to the reaction, the attack fizzles and the attack is still consumed).
  - *AI*: greedy brain sets reactions like any other playable card and does
    NOT play around enemy reactions (v1) — acceptable; NPCs telegraphing
    nothing is part of learning the pool. Revisit if autobattle win rates
    warp.
  - *Documented next rung if counterspells need to feel more active*: a
    depth-1 reaction window ("Reflex") with auto-pass — deliberately NOT
    built now. Full MTG stack: rejected, revisit only on a competitive pivot.
- **Set expansion direction (2026-07-08)**: grow the CORE set in place
  (~17 cards, 29 → 46) rather than opening a second zone-set — the Boarlands
  pack pulls from `cardsInSet('core')` so new cards enter the economy with no
  shop changes, and a second zone deserves its own worldbuilding push. Theme
  the mechanics around what's already unique here: **kindle-matters**
  (`onKindle` triggers — the signature resource becomes a build-around),
  **graveyard-matters** (`exhume` / `graveBuff` primitives — the graveyard
  was tracked but unused), plus the reaction suite and curve fillers for
  sprite families we already have art for. New engine primitives: `counter`,
  `exhume`, `graveBuff`, `resetKindle`; new trigger hook `onKindle`; new
  target selector `trigger` (the unit that tripped a reaction).

- **Buildings must be inline, never instanced (2026-07-08)**: a first pilot
  let players "enter" a house by teleporting them to a small room built far
  away in world space (invisible from the village via scene fog). Michael
  tested it and rejected it: mechanically it worked, but it read as an
  instance/loading-screen moment, not a seamless world — he wants a
  WoW-style single continuous open world. Redone as a true inline interior:
  the house's exterior box became 5 separate wall meshes (one wall split
  into two segments around a 2-unit doorway gap) sitting at the house's real
  world coordinates, with a flat interior ceiling, a small warm point light,
  and per-segment colliders — no teleport, no position jump, walking through
  the gap IS entering, exactly like walking through any other opening.
  `client/src/world.js`'s `house1Interior()` is the reference pattern for
  any future building interior. **Do not propose pocket-dimension/teleport
  rooms again** — this was tried and explicitly rejected.
- **Highgate — southern trade capital (2026-07-08)**: the "second zone"
  worldbuilding push flagged as deferred in the set-expansion decision above.
  Michael asked for a bigger city separate from the starting zone; scoped as
  a **trade hub/capital**, full-hub tier (worldbuilding + NPCs + duelists).
  Decisions:
  - *Reachable, not adjacent*: centered at (40,-145), ~187 units from spawn
    (near the 210 world-boundary clamp) — walking there is a real trip, not
    a village extension. Placed south, clear of both existing camps (Gruk's
    Hollow, Red-Sash Camp). Tagged via the existing CAMPS proximity mechanism
    (constants.js) rather than a new zone system — Highgate isn't a "camp"
    but the {x,z,r,name} shape and zoneAt()/full-map wiring already fit.
  - *Walled, not open*: a 76×76 wall square with corner watchtowers and a
    single north gate (facing back toward the village) — reads as a real
    capital rather than a bigger village, and gives the two new duelists a
    reason to exist (someone has to guard the gate and the road).
  - *No new cards or pack*: deliberately reuses existing core-set cards for
    both new duelists' decks/rewards (`warden_captain`, `counterspark`,
    `pyre_keeper`, `dire_wolf`, `second_harvest`, `thicket_beast` — all
    previously unused by any duelist). Consistent with the set-expansion
    decision above (grow core in place); a Highgate-specific pack/set is a
    plausible future step, not done here. No new vendor either — the
    Boarlands pack stays Marla's thing.
  - *Roster*: Captain Verity (Wardens-based, guards the gate) and Tarn the
    Tollkeeper (Boarherd-based, guards the road just outside it — reachable
    before you even enter). Guildmaster Yara is a non-duelist quest-giver in
    the Merchant Hall, gating a 3-quest chain (`highgate_gate` →
    `highgate_road` → `highgate_ledger`) independent of the Aldric/Vex/Gruk
    chain, so Highgate is its own destination rather than a reward for
    finishing the first one.
  - Not done, flagged for later: a Highgate-specific supply pack/vendor, a
    second card set themed around the capital, fast travel (the walk is
    part of the design intent, but revisit if it feels punishing once played
    live).

## Open questions

- Renown pacing: thresholds 20/60/150 are untested against real play.
- Starter balance: boarherd ~75% vs redsash (AI-vs-AI); needs a card pass.
- Highgate placement/scale is untested in real play — verify the walk feels
  like a destination, not a slog, and that the wall gate doesn't create a
  collision pinch point.
